        Instructions:<br>
        <br>
        This is a story quest - Click on the light blue text to choose your path, try not to die!<br>
        Save and load functions don't really work. Any time you die you will need to restart.<br>
        If you close/refresh your browser you will need to restart game.<br>
        Good luck! And may the odds be ever in your favor!<br>
        You can click on anything in your inventory, but if you use it, it will disappear.
        <br>
        Love, Asaf.
