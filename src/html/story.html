            walking in the dense forest with roots and weeds sticking out is taking quite a bit of a toll on your body.<br>
            You decide to stop talking and focus on the way ahead, at least with the fairies you're not going in circles, maybe this Falafel Wizard or whatever can help you.<br>
            <br>

            The forest clears up a bit and with the fire in the distance you can see a bit better, you've started lagging pretty hard behind the fairies, huffing and puffing as you go.<br>
            Your forehead is sweaty and is leaking to your eyes which you wipe.<br>
            Some branch grabs your arm, you yank your arm to free it, but the branch seems to be stuck to you, holding you with incredible force.<br>
            <br>
            The unexpected resistance in momentum sends you spinning hard to the right.<br>
            Your chest hits another sticky branch and your left leg as well.<br>
            You try to move back without touching anymore of the sticky branches but you are stuck tight.<br>

            You wait a few moments for your eyes to adjust and try to asses your predicament.<br>
            <br>
            You look behind you to see if the fairies are in anyway visible now but the spell is not powerful enough to pierce through the far away darkness.<br>
            You look at the branches that are holding you.<br>

            It is hard to determine colors with the active spell, but the branches that hold you do not seem to be the same dark hue of the tree trunk next to you.<br>
            Your eyes widen as you see that the branch that is holding your leg is connected to the floor of the forest and shoots way up into the darkness above, not emanating from any of the trees above
            but continuing in an exact straight path to the sky above.<br>
            In your surrounding you can see similar such branches(?) connecting between the sky and the ground, in all sort of odd angles.<br>
            <br>
            You start to get very concerned now, these are definitely not branches.<br>
            You pick up a twig from the ground carefully avoiding moving your body that's already stuck to the "ropes", and try to examine the rope holding your arm with the twig.<br>
            <br>
            The rope is taut and the smallest poking of it sends small vibrations up to the dark sky.<br> 
            The twig instantly gets stuck just like the rest of your body and you give up trying to examine it.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly you feel a very small vibration in the rope holding you, you hadn't moved at all, and the vibration seems to emanate from far above you. You look up but all you can see is the rope stretching above to the darkness.<br>
            <br>
            Understanding hits you like a hammer, you are entangled in some enormous creature's web.<br>

            5 wanderers stand a the beginning of a cave, they only have 1 torch.<br>
            The cave is thin and in order to get to the other side they can only go in pairs, but the cave is also dark, and they need the torch to travel with them at all times.<br>

            The Wizard stands up, his bear, sitting beside him, looks up at him for a bit, then goes back to his bone.<br>
            Listen closely the Falafel Wizard proclaims! As I am not used to repeating myself! If you have any questions, keep them to yourself! I can barely hear anything anyway, he winks at Hamburger.<br>
            <br>
            Many centuries ago in a far away land, there lived a Prince, he would spend his days surfing the great waves of Philipinia, at nights he would compete in the highest stakes tournaments, playing with Magic.<br>
            It is said he was able to terraform entire planets and his production was mighty indeed. No one could compete with his prowess. But with his victories, so grew his arrogance.<br>
            For he was not a graceful winner, and would often taunt his defeated foes!<br>
            <br>
            One night while playing with very powerful Magic, a stranger walked up to him.<br>
            The stranger wearing a long black ragged cloak torn and weathered from years of use, with his hood covering most of his face said with a carefully long drawling voice.<br>
            I've heard you were the champion here, he said. I've come to take the title away from you! Sit and play me, if you dare!<br>
            The Prince looked at the ragged stranger, his snobby friends sniggered at his beaten down clothes, he didn't look like any match for the Prince!<br>
            <br>
            Be gone with you friend, said the Prince, I'll not be bothered with someone the likes of you.<br>
            <br>
            The stranger clearly agitated continued. Sir, I've come a long way I'm looking to fight the very best in Magic and they've pointed me to you, now play me, for you are surely to be defeated!<br>
            Be gone with you I said! I've nothing to prove to you! You couldn't possibly beat me if you've tried! The Prince taunted, and yet he was eyeing the stranger carefully, trying to asses if he truly was a worthy opponent.<br>
            The Prince's crowd laughed in disdain.<br>
            The stranger, brimming with sweat and frustration took a seat next to the Prince and showed him his Magic.<br>
            The Prince was impressed, but did not betray any of it, agitating his opponent could prove useful.<br>
            <turn to="temple5">...</turn>

        <page id="temple5">
            The Wizard continued in his loud voice, reverberating through the temple, the bright lights all glistened around.<br>
            <br>
            And so a mighty Magic match was played that day, it is said that the stranger played better than anyone thought possible. But the stranger had one flaw.<br>
            He could not control his emotions and would give in to the taunts and jeers by the Prince, and every time the stranger lost his focus, the Prince would take advantage!<br>
            And so they played for 20 Days and 20 Nights, and finally, the Prince was victorious!<br>
            After such a long battle the stranger got up, cursing to himself, he could have won, had he been more focused and not given in to the Prince's taunts. He looked at the Prince with hate in his eyes.<br>
            He held out his hand to the Prince. You've beaten me through sheer luck he murmured to himself.<br>
            <br>
            The Prince eyed his the offered hand, and was about to take it, but heard the strangers whisper. It was not luck, but skill, the Prince had to use every trick he had ever thought of to outsmart the stranger.<br>
            Pettiness and anger overtook him, instead he raised his hand and proclaimed for all to hear.<br>
            T'was a simple match! The stranger gave a decent fight, but he was no match for me! The title of Magic Champion is still mine, and not to be taken by any such ragged stranger!<br>
            Good Game, Easy! The Prince's friends announced, with disdain in their voices.<br>
            <br>
            The stranger turned to leave, when someone from the jeering crowd threw something at his head. The piece of food exploded in mid air before hitting the stranger with a magical poof, spraying the audience.<br>
            The crowd went silent, the stranger turned around and faced the Prince, he removed his hood, and all could see that the stranger was none other than the mighty magician Roby the Constructor!<br>
            <br>
            An audible gasp went through the crowd, the Prince had turned white, he would not have treated the stranger so if he had known.<br>
            <turn to="temple6">...</turn>
        </page>

        <page id="temple6">
            The sky instantly darkened and thunder could be heard in the distance. Roby seemed much bigger and much more threatening all of the sudden, as if he grew in size.<br>
            I damn you, Terraformer! I damn your family Surfboarder! While I walk this earth you shall be nothing but a ghost, your land shall be layed to ruins and your people shall perish from war and famine.<br>
            Thus I Roby the Constructor have spoken!<br>
            His voice seemed to come from the sky and thunder itself!<br>
            I curse you to the end of days, until the new sun will rise and the one they call {{= story.currChar}} will walk the earth. Until then, you shall be no more!<br>
            Thus I Roby the Constructor have spoken!<br>
            <br>
            Uttering the last syllable a lightning blot rained from the heavens and hit the Prince. Panic ensued, people were fleeing as a terrible lightning storm ravaged the land.<br>
            This lightning storm lasted for 20 days and 20 nights, wrecking havoc amongst the kingdom.<br>
            The Prince was nowhere to be found.<br>
            <br>
            The following centuries were very rough for the Philipinians as mutiny and war ravaged the entire lands. Crops barely yielded any food, and sickness was plentiful.<br>
            The people either left or perished, and the once great kingdom was reduced to rubble. Forests begun to take back the land a few centuries past, but an evil blight has appeared even nature itself is not safe from the Magician's Curse.<br>
            The blight is progressing, corrupting all living things in it's path, leaving room only for rot, death and decay.<br>
            <br>
            In their height the kingdom of Philipinia was a beacon of hope for all, but now it seems all is lost.<br>

            As you turn to leave you hear his deep rumbling voice say, "Good Luck {{= story.currChar}}".<br>
            <br>
            You lead to fairies outside of the temple, it is time you were on your way, lifting curses, destiny, sounds like a load of bullshit to you.<br>

            You are completely helpless in this big forest, and the fairies will only help you because they believe you are the {{= story.currChar}} in that tale.<br>
            You look at the fairies, Hamburger with his usual scowl, and LentilSoup with her charming smile.<br>
            Well, you sigh, I guess <turn to="wayToDesert1">we're going to find the Green Enchantress</turn>. As you start walking you look back at the strange Falafel Temple, you feel like you're going to miss it here.

        <page id="wayToDesert1">
            It's night, a tiny fire lights the gloomy forest, you gathered up some small dead branches, and LentilSoup ignited the fire with a small spark from her hands.<br>
            You've left the Temple of Falafel 3 days past, walking in this dense forest. Now that you have been told you can see signs of the corruption and blight the Falafel Wizard has told you about.<br>
            You haven't encountered any animals in on the way, but at night you can hear scurrying around you, and howls in the distance.<br>
            <br>
            Traveling with the fairies is pretty pleasant, mainly because of LentilSoup which can talk about this and that for days. Hamburger sometimes butts in the conversation to prove a point, and argues his point profusely.<br>
            He can get very stubborn you notice, you've learned that if you want him to shut up you just agree with him for a bit.<br>
            <br>
            At first you were a bit afraid to sleep in the open, imagining terrible yellow eyes coming at you from the darkness above. But LentilSoup calmed you.<br>
            There's no need to be afraid she said, the Spider will only come down once something is snared by it's web, all we have to do is avoid it!<br>
            <br>

            After 12 days of walking, your food was starting to run low, you haven't seen any animals, and even if you did, you don't think you would want to eat these corrupted beings.<br>
            The main food you had, other than the few nuts and berries the fairies somehow always found, was these strange little brown balls the Falafel Wizard has given you.<br>
            But even that was growing short. Despair starts to set in on the party, as the forest seems just as dense as ever, and Hamburger seems more distraught every day.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, from the silent forest some very strange noises are carried to you.<br>

            Even more amazing than that is that he looks like she is instructing a bunch of bees! About 3 dozen bees are lined up on purple mushrooms in front of the purple woman!<br>

            The ancient tree is massive spanning a few kilometers at it's base and disappearing into the darkness of the forest above way above the canopey.<br>
            You walk among it's roots for a few hours, admiring it's ancient beauty, and looking for the way inside.<br>
            <br>
            Within it's humongous roots, you can see a pathway, which on closer inspection is decorated in runes of bees hard at work and a flourishing forest around them.<br>
            The entrence seems to lead into the trees roots underground, it's dark and haunting.<br>

            You lean closer and turn him on his back. <br>
            ** Cough ** <br>
            You can hear his uneven breath and see the blood coming from his mouth, a tree branch is stuck mere inches from his heart halfway impaling him.<br>

            Suddenly, a rumble in the distance, you hear a mighty roar.<br>
            The ground shakes as a large shadow engulfs the cart.<br>
            <br>
            You barely have time to shield your face as the cart goes flying off of the trail and you go hurling through space.<br>

            You can see two small fairies arguing at the edge of the clearing looking worriedly at you.<br>
            You walk over to them and as you get closer you notice that one is male and the other female.<br><br> 
            The female is short (even for fairies) and has long black flowing hair, while the male is hairy with a black beard and silver stubble in his hair. <br>
            <br>
            They stop arguing as you approach and the female quickly hides behind the small hairy shoulders of the male.<br>

            The male puffs his chest and looks you down, raising his fists and a tiny voice he cries:<br>

            Be gone from our clearing you overgrown cockhair!<br>
            <br>

            You might be too retarded to understand, he continues, so I'll repeat it slower for you, Gooooooo Awaaaaayyyy Fartfaceeeeeeee!!<br>
            We fairies possess powerful magic and can instantly turn you into a river frog, which in your case would be an improvement!<br><br>
