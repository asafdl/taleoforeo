            walking in the dense forest with roots and weeds sticking out is taking quite a bit of a toll on your body.<br>
            You decide to stop talking and focus on the way ahead, at least with the fairies you're not going in circles, maybe this Falafel Wizard or whatever can help you.<br>
            <br>

            The forest clears up a bit and with the fire in the distance you can see a bit better, you've started lagging pretty hard behind the fairies, huffing and puffing as you go.<br>
            Your forehead is sweaty and is leaking to your eyes which you wipe.<br>
            Some branch grabs your arm, you yank your arm to free it, but the branch seems to be stuck to you, holding you with incredible force.<br>
            <br>
            The unexpected resistance in momentum sends you spinning hard to the right.<br>
            Your chest hits another sticky branch and your left leg as well.<br>
            You try to move back without touching anymore of the sticky branches but you are stuck tight.<br>

            You recall in your memory a spell that will let you see a bit better in the darkness of the forest. You speak the words, and squint your eyes, 
            the spell starts taking hold as the world around you seems to turn to shades of gray.<br>
            You wait a few moments for your eyes to adjust and try to asses your predicament.<br>
            <br>
            You look behind you to see if the fairies are in anyway visible now but the spell is not powerful enough to pierce through the far away darkness.<br>
            You look at the branches that are holding you.<br>
            <br>
            It is hard to determine colors with the active spell, but the branches that hold you do not seem to be the same dark hue of the tree trunk next to you.<br>
            Your eyes widen as you see that the branch that is holding your leg is connected to the floor of the forest and shoots way up into the darkness above, not emanating from any of the trees above
            but continuing in an exact straight path to the sky above.<br>
            In your surrounding you can see similar such branches(?) connecting between the sky and the ground, in all sort of odd angles.<br>
            <br>
            You start to get very concerned now, these are definitely not branches.<br>
            You pick up a twig from the ground carefully avoiding moving your body that's already stuck to the "ropes", and try to examine the rope holding your arm with the twig.<br>
            <br>
            The rope is taut and the smallest poking of it sends small vibrations up to the dark sky.<br> 
            The twig instantly gets stuck just like the rest of your body and you give up trying to examine it.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly you feel a very small vibration in the rope holding you, you hadn't moved at all, and the vibration seems to emanate from far above you. You look up but all you can see is the rope stretching above to the darkness.<br>
            <br>
            Understanding hits you like a hammer, you are entangled in some enormous creature's web.<br>

            It is said he was able to terraform entire planets and his production was mighty indeed. No one could compete with his prowess. But with his victories, so grew his arrogance.<br>
            For he was not a graceful winner, and would often taunt his defeated foes!<br>
            <br>
            One night while playing with very powerful Magic, a stranger walked up to him.<br>
            The stranger wearing a long black ragged cloak torn and weathered from years of use, with his hood covering most of his face said with a carefully long drawling voice.<br>
            I've heard you were the champion here, he said. I've come to take the title away from you! Sit and play me, if you dare!<br>
            The Prince looked at the ragged stranger, his snobby friends sniggered at his beaten down clothes, he didn't look like any match for the Prince!<br>
            <br>
            Be gone with you friend, said the Prince, I'll not be bothered with someone the likes of you.<br>
            <br>
            The stranger clearly agitated continued. Sir, I've come a long way I'm looking to fight the very best in Magic and they've pointed me to you, now play me, for you are surely to be defeated!<br>
            Be gone with you I said! I've nothing to prove to you! You couldn't possibly beat me if you've tried! The Prince taunted, and yet he was eyeing the stranger carefully, trying to asses if he truly was a worthy opponent.<br>
            The Prince's crowd laughed in disdain.<br>
            The stranger, brimming with sweat and frustration took a seat next to the Prince and showed him his Magic.<br>
            The Prince was impressed, but did not betray any of it, agitating his opponent could prove useful.<br>

            The Wizard continued in his loud voice, reverberating through the temple, the bright lights all glistened around.<br>
            <br>
            And so a mighty Magic match was played that day, it is said that the stranger played better than anyone thought possible. But the stranger had one flaw.<br>
            He could not control his emotions and would give in to the taunts and jeers by the Prince, and every time the stranger lost his focus, the Prince would take advantage!<br>
            And so they played for 20 Days and 20 Nights, and finally, the Prince was victorious!<br>
            After such a long battle the stranger got up, cursing to himself, he could have won, had he been more focused and not given in to the Prince's taunts. He looked at the Prince with hate in his eyes.<br>
            He held out his hand to the Prince. You've beaten me through sheer luck he murmured to himself.<br>
            <br>
            The Prince eyed his the offered hand, and was about to take it, but heard the strangers whisper. It was not luck, but skill, the Prince had to use every trick he had ever thought of to outsmart the stranger.<br>
            Pettiness and anger overtook him, instead he raised his hand and proclaimed for all to hear.<br>
            T'was a simple match! The stranger gave a decent fight, but he was no match for me! The title of Magic Champion is still mine, and not to be taken by any such ragged stranger!<br>
            Good Game, Easy! The Prince's friends announced, with disdain in their voices.<br>
            <br>
            The stranger turned to leave, when someone from the jeering crowd threw something at his head. The piece of food exploded in mid air before hitting the stranger with a magical poof, spraying the audience.<br>
            The crowd went silent, the stranger turned around and faced the Prince, he removed his hood, and all could see that the stranger was none other than the mighty magician Noam of Hefio!<br>
            <br>
            An audible gasp went through the crowd, the Prince had turned white, he would not have treated the stranger so if he had known.<br>

        <page id="temple6">
            The sky instantly darkened and thunder could be heard in the distance. Noam seemed much bigger and much more threatening all of the sudden, as if he grew in size.<br>
            I damn you, Terraformer! I damn your family Surfboarder! While I walk this earth you shall be nothing but a ghost, your land shall be layed to ruins and your people shall perish from war and famine.<br>
            Thus I Noam of Heifo have spoken!<br>
            His voice seemed to come from the sky and thunder itself!<br>
            I curse you to the end of days, until the new sun will rise and the one they call {{= story.currChar}} will walk the earth. Until then, you shall be no more!<br>
            Thus I Noam of Heifo have spoken!<br>
            <br>
            Uttering the last syllable a lightning blot rained from the heavens and hit the Prince. Panic ensued, people were fleeing as a terrible lightning storm ravaged the land.<br>
            This lightning storm lasted for 20 days and 20 nights, wrecking havoc amongst the kingdom.<br>
            The Prince was nowhere to be found.<br>
            <br>
            The following centuries were very rough for the Philipinians as mutiny and war ravaged the entire lands. Crops barely yielded any food, and sickness was plentiful.<br>
            The people either left or perished, and the once great kingdom was reduced to rubble. Forests begun to take back the land a few centuries past, but an evil blight has appeared even nature itself is not safe from the Magician's Curse.<br>
            The blight is progressing, corrupting all living things in it's path, leaving room only for rot, death and decay.<br>
            <br>
            In their height the kingdom of Philipinia was a beacon of hope for all, but now it seems all is lost.<br>

            You can see two small fairies arguing at the edge of the clearing looking worriedly at you.<br>
            You walk over to them and as you get closer you notice that one is male and the other female.<br><br> 
            The female is short (even for fairies) and has long black flowing hair, while the male is hairy with a black beard and silver stubble in his hair. <br>
            <br>
            They stop arguing as you approach and the female quickly hides behind the small hairy shoulders of the male.<br>
