            <br>
            Your breathing is getting a bit rough because of the hard trek. The fairies are flying very fast and even as fit as you are,
            walking in the dense forest with roots and weeds sticking out is taking quite a bit of a toll on your body.<br>
            You decide to stop talking and focus on the way ahead, at least with the fairies you're not going in circles, maybe this Falafel Wizard or whatever can help you.<br>
            <br>
            The trees start to spread out farther apart, you think you can see a light in the distant gloom, is that a fire?<br>

            The forest clears up a bit and with the fire in the distance you can see a bit better, you've started lagging pretty hard behind the fairies, huffing and puffing as you go.<br>
            Your forehead is sweaty and is leaking to your eyes which you wipe.<br>
            Some branch grabs your arm, you yank your arm to free it, but the branch seems to be stuck to you, holding you with incredible force.<br>
            <br>
            The unexpected resistance in momentum sends you spinning hard to the right.<br>
            Your chest hits another sticky branch and your left leg as well.<br>
            You try to move back without touching anymore of the sticky branches but you are stuck tight.<br>
            You look behind you for the fairies but cannot see them anymore in the gloom, just the distant fire.<br>

            You recall in your memory a spell that will let you see a bit better in the darkness of the forest. You speak the words, and squint your eyes, 
            the spell starts taking hold as the world around you seems to turn to shades of gray.<br>
            You wait a few moments for your eyes to adjust and try to asses your predicament.<br>
            <br>
            You look behind you to see if the fairies are in anyway visible now but the spell is not powerful enough to pierce through the far away darkness.<br>
            You look at the branches that are holding you.<br>
            <br>
            It is hard to determine colors with the active spell, but the branches that hold you do not seem to be the same dark hue of the tree trunk next to you.<br>
            Your eyes widen as you see that the branch that is holding your leg is connected to the floor of the forest and shoots way up into the darkness above, not emanating from any of the trees above
            but continuing in an exact straight path to the sky above.<br>
            In your surrounding you can see similar such branches(?) connecting between the sky and the ground, in all sort of odd angles.<br>
            <br>
            You start to get very concerned now, these are definitely not branches.<br>
            You pick up a twig from the ground carefully avoiding moving your body that's already stuck to the "ropes", and try to examine the rope holding your arm with the twig.<br>
            <br>
            The rope is taut and the smallest poking of it sends small vibrations up to the dark sky.<br> 
            The twig instantly gets stuck just like the rest of your body and you give up trying to examine it.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly you feel a very small vibration in the rope holding you, you hadn't moved at all, and the vibration seems to emanate from far above you. You look up but all you can see is the rope stretching above to the darkness.<br>
            <br>
            Understanding hits you like a hammer, you are entangled in some enormous creature's web.<br>

                The forest ceiling is illuminated in strange lights as your hear the squeaky voices of the fairies casting spells to distract the beast.<br>

                To this the Spider responds, it appears as if it wants to flee but is undecided, it's prey is immobilized and ripe for the taking, and such a plump prey it is!<br>
                You hear the deep voice yell again and a brown glowing ball is flung at the Spider, leaving a trail of light behind it.<br>
                <br>
                The Spider is hit and trembles from the force of it. It raises it's ugly head and peers at the old Wizard.<br>
                Decided on a course of action the Spider suddenly leaps from you and hits hard one of the tree trunks above you.<br>
                It quickly latches on to one of it's webs and scurries away so fast, you're not even sure what tree it was on a moment ago, it disappears into the darkness above.<br>
                <br>
                Lying on the floor breathing hard, you struggle to stay awake as the poison takes it's toll on your body.<br>
                You swear you can see yellow eyes above in the distance, but your consciousness is almost gone, before you pass out, the strange Falafel Wizard comes into your view.<br>
                He has pink skin, crazy white curly hair and kind eyes. You faint.<br>
